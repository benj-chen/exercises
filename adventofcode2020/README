Each problem has 2 answers. The answer to the first part is enclosed in a comment starting in:
# Part 1 answer
followed by the answer, then a newline followed by the command that will reveal the answer when ran.
For example, if the answer to Part 1 was 100, and to print it required some counter:
# Part 1 answer 100
print(counter)

The same goes for Part 2. To show the answer in the output space or display, run the file from the
command line with python3 dec[day].py

Days in which I cheated because my solution didn't run fast enough begin with "cheat_". The sources and users who
I pulled from are included in the code as comments. Code lines that I pulled from another source end in a single line
comment #. That said, you can still view my attempt at the problem below the cheated code.
