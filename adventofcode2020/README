Some python files contain very new syntax, namely the "walrus operator", or the use of :=, which creates or changes
a variable and returns it at the same time. First seen in Python 3.8. If your running of the file doesn't work, consider
upgrading your Python version to 3.8 or better. For more information on the walrus opeartor, see:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/
Each problem has 2 answers. The answer to the first part is enclosed in a comment starting in:
# Part 1 answer
followed by the answer, then a newline followed by the command that will reveal the answer when ran.
For example, if the answer to Part 1 was 100, and to print it required some counter:
# Part 1 answer 100
print(counter)

The same goes for Part 2. To show the answer in the output space or display, run the file from the
command line with:

python3 d[day number].py

Days on which I cheated because my solution didn't run fast enough end with "inf.py", for example,
"d13inf.py" (inf stands for infeasible). The sources and users who I pulled from, along with the code that produces a
fast, feasible solution, are included in "better_sols.py".
Infeasible files still have my attempt at the solution. They work, but do not run fast enough to be good. Please run
infeasible files at your own risk. The code may run for many days or weeks.
Code lines in better_sols that are not my work end in a single-line comment #.

Days on which I wanted to solve later out of being confused, lazy, or busy end with "inc.py". (inc stands for incomplete)

Days on which I completed correctly and in a feasible time only contain "d" and the day, for example, "d1.py".

Input files start with "i", followed by the day. They do not end with a ".txt".
