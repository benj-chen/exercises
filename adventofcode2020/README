Each problem has 2 answers. The answer to the first part is enclosed in a comment starting in:
# Part 1 answer
followed by the answer, then a colon followed by the command that will reveal the answer when ran.
For example, if the answer to Part 1 was 100, and to print it required some counter:
# Part 1 answer 100: print(counter)

The same goes for Part 2. To show the answer in the output space or display, uncomment the answer line starting from
the colon and working backward. They will be in print form to be seen in sys.stdout.
