Each problem has 2 answers. The answer to the first part is enclosed in a comment starting in:
# Part 1 answer
followed by the answer, then a newline followed by the command that will reveal the answer when ran.
For example, if the answer to Part 1 was 100, and to print it required some counter:
# Part 1 answer 100
print(counter)

The same goes for Part 2. To show the answer in the output space or display, run the file from the
command line with python3 [day].py
