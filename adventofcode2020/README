Each problem has 2 answers. The answer to the first part is enclosed in a comment starting in:
# Part 1 answer
followed by the answer, then a newline followed by the command that will reveal the answer when ran.
For example, if the answer to Part 1 was 100, and to print it required some counter:
# Part 1 answer 100
print(counter)

The same goes for Part 2. To show the answer in the output space or display, run the file from the
command line with:

python3 d[day number].py

Days on which I cheated because my solution didn't run fast enough begin with "cheat_", for example,
"cheat_d13.py". The sources and users who I pulled from are included in the code as comments.
Code lines that are not my work end in a single-line comment #. That said, you can still
view my attempt at the problem below the cheated code.

Days on which I wanted to solve later out of being confused, lazy, or busy end with "inc.py".

Days on which I completed correctly start with "d", for example, "d1.py".

Input files start with "i", followed by the day. They do not end with a ".txt".
