Basic problems that I would give to a beginner programmer that are a bit more useful than stuff like codingbat.

anagram: Compare two strings. Are they anagrams? Adding punctuation is fine, but not newlines (pressing enter). (https://billwurtz.com/anagrams/anagrams.html)[https://billwurtz.com/anagrams/anagrams.html]

song_time: Take time stamps from a song (the user does this) and find the section of the song that's closest to, say, 20 seconds (if you're washing your hands) or 2 minutes (if you're brushing your teeth). Hum this section to do something for an accurate amount of time!
