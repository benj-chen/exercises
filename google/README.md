## Codejam

Similar to USACO in that it has algorithmic problems. There's one 30 hour-long qualifying competition, then rounds 1,2,3, then world finals.

As long as you have enough points (pass enough test sets) in the qualifying round, you can advance to round 1. The top 1500 contestants in round 1 go to round 2. The top 1000 contestants in round 2 go to round 3. The top 25 contestants in round 3 go to world finals.

## Kickstart

There are 8-ish rounds every year, each round independent of each other. Each round is 3 hours long and features a variety of difficulty.
