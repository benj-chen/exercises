Coding challenges from places like [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) and [cses.fi](https://cses.fi)

## USACO
The 'usacobronze' directory features solutions to past USACO competitions. As the directory name suggests, said solutions are at the USACO Bronze level.

## CSES
The 'cses' directory contains solutions from [cses.fi](https://cses.fi). Solutions have to pass test cases with a runtime limit of 1.00 sec and a memory limit of 512 MB. Files beginning with an asterisk (\*) mark the incomplete ones. When running all programs, there is **no prompt for input**, as per the website guidelines. Please read the website attached to each file to learn about the problem and parameters.

## EULER.NET
The 'euler.net' directory has solutions from the 'archives' section at [https://projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). They are grouped into 10 problems per Python file. There is no runitme cap and no memory cap.

## ADVENTOFCODE2020
The 'adventofcode2020' directory features solutions from daily problems from [https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). There are two problems for each day of the month of December. The daily problems, when strung together, make a complete story revolving around Santa.

## CODEFORCES
Mainly to serve as c++11 practice problems, I include a .md file with each problem to explain what I did. I'll update problems with better methods as I continue to learn c++. As CF is based in Moscow, all of the live competitions are out of my time zone, so I only do practice problems.

## CODECHEF
For practice, from the website [https://codechef.com](https://codechef.com). Similar to codeforces. As Code Chef is based in India, all of the live competitions are out of my time zone, so I only do practice problems.

## GOOGLE
Problems from Google's Kickstart and Codejam competitions

## LEETCODE
Solve whatever LeetCode problems I feel like doing. Particularly interested in the daily challenge, even though those are just reruns of problemset problems. It gives me problems of varying difficulty and different subjects.
