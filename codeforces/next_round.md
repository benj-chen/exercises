First, get the input. I specially added a -1 to the end of the array containing scores, the reason revealed in a minute. Because I wanted to comparisons to use > and not >=, the compare variable became whatever was at the index -1. An important part of the rules says that the contestant must have a positive score. If the compare variable is -1 (really 0 in the input), make that 0 (an input of 0 shouldn't count). Although I originally wanted to use the fmax function found in the cmath library, I decided against it because it would probably be a performance cost to import cmath. Plus, I think I did a good job indicating what it did. It's also given that the input is in descending order. This is important because as soon as the program has a number that doesn't meet the requirements, it immediately prints the total and exits out. I didn't bother copy-pasting code at the end to cover the case in which all inputs pass the compare variable, which is why I included the -1 at the end of the array containing scores, which is guaranteed to be less than 0.
