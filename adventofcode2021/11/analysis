Part a:

The main thing here is flash. I have a bool orig that is true if the function call is for a cell
that flashed "naturally", that is, flashed because of the cycle causing it to go up only, which is
obviously true at the original function call point and false otherwise. The double for loop produces
i and j such that at least one is non-zero. I also note that if the spot that I'm testing is 10 then
it has not officially flashed yet, and will flash right after; if it is over 10 it has already
flashed and we shouldn't flash again.

Part b:

Just do what you did before, but modify the thing that counts the number of times. Start at 1
because after the loop it will have been t times.
